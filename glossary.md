# Glossary for Neural Networks

* **Activation function** : 

* **Array** : An ordered homologous container for numbers, which can have one or more dimensions (N.b. In the context of nnfs book)

* **Bias** : 

* **Classification** : The process of recognising, understanding, and grouping ideas and objects into preset categories or “sub-populations”

* **Cross product** : 

* **Dense layer** : A layer in which each neuron of a given layer is connected to every neuron of the next layer

* **Dot product** : Is the sum of products of consecutive vecor elements (e.g. the multiplication and addition operations performed on 'weights' and 'inputs' of a neuron)

* **Feature** : An individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon

* **Fully connected neural network** : A neural network where every neuron in the current layer has connection to every neuron from the previous layer

* **Generalisation** : The process of training a model to accurately predict on training data as well as out-of sample data

* **Hidden layers** : The layers inbetween the inputs and outputs in a Neural Network 

* **Homologous** : An array (e.g. a list of lists) where each list is the same length

* **Loss** : How 'wrong' a model is when making predictions

* **Matrix** : Is a retangular array with two dimensions (e.g. a list of lists) 

* **(Artificial) Neural networks** : Type of machine learning, often used for deep learning

* **Neuron** : A mathmatical function that takes one or more inputs and multiplys them by weights

* **Normalisation** : 

* **Overfitting** : Refers to a model that models the training data too well, which negatively impacts the performance of the model when presented with new data

* **Parameters** : The weights and biases of a neural network. 

* **Preprocess** : Converting 'raw' data into numeric form using function such as `normalisation' and 'scaling'

* **Rectified Linear (ReLU) activation function** : 

* **Regression** : A method for prediciting numerical values (e.g. stock prices) 

* **Scaling** : 

* **Step function** : 

* **Supervised learning** : A form of machine learning where a pre-established and labeled data set can be used to train the model 

* **Tensor** : A tensor object is an object that can be represented as an array  

* **Unsupervised learning** : A form of machine learning where the a machine finds structure in data without knowing the classifications ahead of time

* **Vector** : An array with a single dimension (e.g. a list)

* **Weight** : A trainable factor of how much of an input is used
